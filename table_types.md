# Table types

One major use of kdb is as a database, and there are five types of tables that suit different different use cases.  The details mostly have to do with persistence, and from an access/usage standpoint there is very little differences (i.e. the user does not need to be aware of the underlying structure).

## In-memory table


## Single-file table


## Splayed table


## Partitioned table


## Segmented table
